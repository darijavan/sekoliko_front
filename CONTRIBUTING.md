# Introduction

### Yay you rock !

> First off, thank you for considering contributing to this project . It's people like you that make this world so great.

# Getting started

### A quick walkthrough of how to submit a contribution.

Let's assume that you need to implement a new feature called for example "Login Feature"

- First thing you need to do is to create an issue, after that you need to explain what you plan to do,

- Next, create a branch related to the current issue, open your code editor and pull changes

```bash
git pull
```

- You should see the newly created branch, then checkout to.

```bash
git checkout {the-branch}
```

** Then do your stuff **

- After you've finished, you need to commit your work

** There's a rule for committing **

The template

```bash
git commit -m [{zone}] {work summary} #{branch}
```

For example

```bash
git commit -m [LOGIN] implement login controller #2-login
```

or

```bash
git commit -m [DASHBOARD] integrate dashboard html-css #4-dashboard
```

- Finally, push your code to the branch , and open a pull request.

** NB **

When you are sure about your code then only , open a pull request to the master branch , we'll review your code and accept it or not based on your work

# How to report a bug

### How to file a bug report.

> When filing an issue, make sure to answer these five questions:
>
> 1. What version of NodeJS are you using (version)?
> 2. What operating system and processor architecture are you using?
> 3. What did you do?
> 4. What did you expect to see?
> 5. What did you see instead?

Include a sceenshot if possible. Then open an issue and we'll discuss about it.

# Ground Rules

### Our expectations :

This includes not just how to communicate with others (being respectful, considerate, etc) but also technical responsibilities (importance of testing, project dependencies, etc). Mention and link to your code of conduct, if you have one.

> Responsibilities
>
> - Ensure cross-platform compatibility for every change that's accepted. Windows, Mac, Debian & Ubuntu Linux.
> - Create issues for any major changes and enhancements that you wish to make. Discuss things transparently and get community feedback.

### You really don't know what to do ? .

Here are a couple of friendly tutorials you can include: http://makeapullrequest.com/ and http://www.firsttimersonly.com/

> Working on your first Pull Request? You can learn how from this _free_ series, [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://egghead.io/series/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github).

> At this point, you're ready to make your changes! Feel free to ask for help; everyone is a beginner at first :smile_cat:
>
> If a maintainer asks you to "rebase" your PR, they're saying that a lot of code has changed, and that you need to update your branch so it's easier to merge.
